# MyReads Project

This is an implementation of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The application consists of two views: Bookshelf and Search.  

In Bookshelf, you can see the books on your shelf, categorized by "Want to Read," "Currently Reading," and "Read."  In the search page, you can search for books and add them to your shelf.

## Getting Started

Clone the git repo and use npm to install the dependency and start the server
